abstract = {
    Here we present Narupa iMD, an open-source software package which enables
    multiple users to cohabit the same virtual reality space and interact
    with real-time molecular simulations. The framework utilizes a
    client-server architecture which links a flexible Python server to a VR
    client which handles the rendering and user interface. This design helps
    ensure utility for research communities, by enabling easy access to a
    wide range of molecular simulation engines for visualization and
    manipulation of simulated nanoscale dynamics at interactive speeds.
