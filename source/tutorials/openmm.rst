A set of tutorials that demonstrate how to use NanoVer to run interactive molecular
dynamics simulations using OpenMM directly.

The Jupyter notebook tutorial that demonstrates how to run interactive molecular
dynamics simulations by interfacing NanoVer with OpenMM directly can be found in
the `examples <https://github.com/IRL2/nanover-protocol/tree/main/examples/openmm>`_
folder of the GitHub repository. It contains:

* `OpenMM runner`: A notebook that demonstrates how to set up interactive molecular
  dynamics simulations within NanoVer using OpenMM directly, including creation of
  input files, running the simulation and saving the generated trajectories.
