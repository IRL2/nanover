LAMMPS: Large scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator
=================================================================

A set of tutorials that demonstrate how to use NanoVer to run interactive molecular
dynamics simulations using LAMMPS. We are aware that the current tutorials for
interfacing LAMMPS with NanoVer are incomplete
(see `Issue #84 <https://github.com/IRL2/nanover-protocol/issues/184>`_), and are
working to resolve these problems.
